OREVI_PCH: An Optimized Resource-Efficient Redaction Mechanism with Integrity Validation in Policy-based Chameleon Hash for IoT Applications

Welcome to the OREVI_PCH repository! This project implements a highly efficient redactable blockchain mechanism.

We use Python with the Charm framework to implement OREVI_PCH. This mechanism secures blockchain rewriting, providing a construction for blockchain data redaction with reduced computational requirements and validating the honest behavior of data owners.

Implementation Details
The implementation includes five algorithms: setup, keygen, hash, verify, and adapt.

We evaluate the performance of the keygen, hash, verify and adapt algorithms in terms of the number of attributes and the size of policies. The performance of these algorithms is linear to the number of attributes (e.g., from 1 to 100) and the size of policies.
